# Journey Mapping Framework

The **Journey Mapping** framework helps users visualize the steps, friction points, and passion points in a user’s journey. It also identifies moments that matter and opportunities for improvement, providing a comprehensive understanding of the user experience.

## Purpose
The Journey Mapping framework helps teams:
- Visualize the user’s journey, including steps, friction points, and passion points.
- Identify moments that matter and opportunities for improvement.
- Develop strategies to enhance the user experience.

## Sections
The framework includes the following components:

1. **Journey Steps (5E Framework)**:
   - **Entice**: How the user becomes aware of and attracted to the product, service, or experience.
     - Example: A user sees a targeted ad on social media.
   - **Enter**: The user’s first interaction or onboarding experience.
     - Example: Signing up for a free trial on a website.
   - **Engage**: How the user interacts with the product, service, or experience over time.
     - Example: Regularly using a fitness app to track workouts.
   - **Exit**: The user’s process of leaving or completing the experience.
     - Example: Cancelling a subscription after achieving fitness goals.
   - **Extend**: How the experience continues to provide value or maintain a relationship after the user exits.
     - Example: Receiving follow-up emails with tips and offers.

2. **Friction Points**:
   - Identify pain points or obstacles the user encounters at each step of the 5E framework.
   - Describe the impact of these friction points on the user experience.
   - Example: Difficulty navigating the app during onboarding.

3. **Passion Points**:
   - Highlight moments where the user experiences delight or strong positive emotions.
   - Describe what contributes to these passion points.
   - Example: Unlocking a milestone badge in the app.

4. **Moments That Matter**:
   - Identify critical moments in the journey that have the greatest impact on the user’s overall experience.
   - Categorize these moments as opportunities for improvement or areas to amplify.
   - Example: A seamless checkout process that encourages repeat purchases.

5. **Opportunities for Improvement**:
   - Suggest specific actions or changes to address friction points and enhance moments that matter.
   - Example: Simplifying the onboarding process to reduce user drop-off rates.

## Definitions
