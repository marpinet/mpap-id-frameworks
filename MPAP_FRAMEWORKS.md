# MPAP Frameworks: A Comprehensive Guide

The **MPAP Frameworks** website is an interactive platform designed to guide designers and teams through structured sense-making processes. Inspired by Vijay Kumar’s *101 Design Methods*, the platform provides tools to interact with design frameworks, save results, and streamline the application of design methods.

## Purpose
The MPAP Frameworks platform aims to:
- Provide a structured approach to design thinking and problem-solving.
- Help users gain preliminary context for any problem space.
- Enable teams to synthesize research, map systems, and develop actionable strategies.

## Key Features
1. **Framework Interaction**:
   - Users can interact with frameworks in three ways:
     1. **Upload Files**: Upload documents, images, or data to auto-fill sections of the frameworks.
     2. **Chat with AI**: Use an AI agent to answer questions, perform secondary research, and generate framework content.
     3. **Guided Steps**: Follow detailed instructions to manually complete frameworks.

2. **Framework Outputs**:
   - Outputs are presented as structured documents, diagrams, or tables.
   - Users can download results as PDFs or save them to their profiles for future reference or reuse.

3. **Collaboration and Profiles**:
   - Users can save and organize completed frameworks in folders.
   - Teams can collaborate on frameworks in real-time.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Light and dark themes for better usability.

5. **Privacy and Security**:
   - Files are encrypted in transit, and users can delete their data at any time.

## Framework Categories
The platform organizes frameworks into five sections, each addressing a specific stage of the design process:

1. **Sensing Intent**:
   - Frameworks: [Project Charter](Project_Charter_Framework.md), [Project Brief](Project_Brief_Framework.md), [Canvas Business Plan](Canvas_Business_Plan_Framework.md).
   - Purpose: Define the project’s scope, goals, and foundational elements.

2. **Knowing Content**:
   - Frameworks: [Resource-Based Analysis](Resource_Based_Analysis_Framework.md), [System Mapping](System_Mapping_Framework.md), [Market Segmentation](Market_Segmentation_Framework.md).
   - Purpose: Analyze resources, systems, and markets to understand the problem space.

3. **Knowing People**:
   - Frameworks: [Stakeholder Mapping](Stakeholder_Mapping_Framework.md), [Power Dynamics Mapping](Power_Dynamics_Mapping_Framework.md), [Synthesize Research](Synthesize_Research_Framework.md).
   - Purpose: Understand stakeholders, their dynamics, and research findings.

4. **Framing Insights**:
   - Frameworks: [Journey Mapping](Journey_Mapping_Framework.md), [Translating Themes to Opportunity Spaces](Translating_Themes_to_Opportunity_Spaces_Framework.md).
   - Purpose: Visualize user journeys and convert insights into actionable opportunities.

5. **Framing Solutions**:
   - Frameworks: [Strategic Purpose](Strategic_Purpose_Framework.md), [Strategic Roadmap](Strategic_Roadmap_Framework.md), [Leverage Points and Interventions](Leverage_Points_and_Interventions_Framework.md).
   - Purpose: Define strategic goals, roadmaps, and interventions for impactful solutions.

## Framework Details
Each framework is designed with the following components:
- **Purpose**: Explains the framework’s role in the design process.
- **Sections**: Breaks down the framework into actionable steps.
- **Interaction Methods**: Describes how users can interact with the framework (upload files, chat with AI, or guided steps).
- **Output**: Details the final deliverables, such as structured documents, diagrams, or PDFs.

For detailed descriptions of each framework, refer to the following files:
- [Project Charter Framework](Project_Charter_Framework.md)
- [Project Brief Framework](Project_Brief_Framework.md)
- [Canvas Business Plan Framework](Canvas_Business_Plan_Framework.md)
- [Resource-Based Analysis Framework](Resource_Based_Analysis_Framework.md)
- [System Mapping Framework](System_Mapping_Framework.md)
- [Market Segmentation Framework](Market_Segmentation_Framework.md)
- [Stakeholder Mapping Framework](Stakeholder_Mapping_Framework.md)
- [Power Dynamics Mapping Framework](Power_Dynamics_Mapping_Framework.md)
- [Synthesize Research Framework](Synthesize_Research_Framework.md)
- [Journey Mapping Framework](Journey_Mapping_Framework.md)
- [Translating Themes to Opportunity Spaces Framework](Translating_Themes_to_Opportunity_Spaces_Framework.md)
- [Strategic Purpose Framework](Strategic_Purpose_Framework.md)
- [Strategic Roadmap Framework](Strategic_Roadmap_Framework.md)
- [Leverage Points and Interventions Framework](Leverage_Points_and_Interventions_Framework.md)

## Technical Details
The platform is built with the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, data storage, and file management.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel with automatic deployment via GitHub integration.

For more information on technical decisions, refer to the [TECHDECISIONS.md](TECHDECISIONS.md) file.

## Future Updates
The platform is a work in progress. Planned updates include:
- Additional frameworks and methods.
- Enhanced collaboration features.
- Improved AI capabilities for secondary research and framework generation.
