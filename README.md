# MPAP-ID Frameworks

MPAP-ID Frameworks is an interactive website designed to help designers and teams gain preliminary context for any problem space and guide design thinking through structured sense-making processes. The platform provides tools to interact with design frameworks, save results, and streamline the application of design methods.

## Key Features
- **Framework Interaction**: Users can interact with frameworks in three ways:
  1. Upload files and pictures for automated framework completion.
  2. Chat with an AI agent to answer questions and perform secondary research.
  3. Follow a guided step-by-step process to fill out frameworks manually.
- **Framework Results**: Outputs are presented as diagrams, tables, or text, which can be downloaded as PDFs or saved to the user’s profile.
- **User Profiles**: Save and organize filled-out frameworks in folders for reuse in other projects.
- **Collaboration**: Invite team members to collaborate on frameworks in real-time.

## Framework Categories
The platform is inspired by Vijay Kumar’s 101 Design Methods and organizes frameworks into five sections:
1. **Sensing Intent**: Project Charter, Project Brief, Canvas Business Plan.
2. **Knowing Content**: Resource-based analysis, System Mapping, Market Segmentation, and more.
3. **Knowing People**: Stakeholder Mapping, Power Dynamics Mapping, Synthesizing Research.
4. **Framing Insights**: Journey Mapping, Translating Themes to Opportunity Spaces.
5. **Framing Solutions**: Strategic Purpose, Strategic Roadmap, Strategic Statement.

## User Flows
### First-Time Users
1. Select a section and framework.
2. Read instructions on the framework.
3. Choose an interaction method (upload, chat, or guided steps).
4. Review and iterate on the filled-out framework.
5. Download or save the framework to a profile.

### Repeat Users
- Access saved frameworks from the profile to reuse or build upon them.
- Collaborate with team members on frameworks in real-time.

## Accessibility
- Light and dark theme options for better usability.

## AI Agent and Research
- Integrates academic databases for secondary research.
- Displays citations and sources for all AI-generated content.
- Includes clear disclaimers about potential inaccuracies or biases.

## Privacy and Security
- Files are encrypted in transit.
- Users can delete their uploaded files and data at any time.

## Framework Flexibility
- Users can upload their own frameworks for personal use.

## Legal Compliance
- Complies with data protection regulations aligned with best practices in Chicago, Illinois (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
