# Stakeholder Mapping Framework

The **Stakeholder Mapping** framework helps users identify and categorize stakeholders based on their influence, interest, and roles in a project or system. It also provides an optional analysis of stakeholders through the lens of the 8 capitals of innovation.

## Purpose
The Stakeholder Mapping framework helps teams:
- Identify and categorize stakeholders based on their influence, interest, and roles.
- Understand stakeholder dynamics and their impact on the project or system.
- Optionally analyze stakeholders through the 8 capitals of innovation to assess their resource contributions.

## Sections
The framework includes the following components:

1. **Stakeholder Identification**:
   - List all relevant stakeholders.
   - Define their roles in the project or system.
   - Example: Stakeholder A (Role: Project Manager, Influence: High, Interest: High).

2. **Stakeholder Categorization**:
   - Map stakeholders based on:
     - **Influence**: High, medium, or low.
     - **Interest**: High, medium, or low.
   - Place stakeholders in a 2x2 matrix (Influence vs. Interest).
   - Example: Stakeholder B (Influence: Medium, Interest: High).

3. **Stakeholder Roles**:
   - Define the specific roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder.
   - Highlight key decision-makers, contributors, and affected parties.
   - Example: Stakeholder C is responsible for approving project budgets.

4. **Optional: 8 Capitals Analysis**:
   - Assess stakeholders’ contributions across the 8 capitals of innovation:
     - Financial, Political, Social, Digital, Natural, Manufactured, Cultural, Human.
   - Identify which stakeholders provide critical resources in each capital.
   - Example: Stakeholder D contributes significantly to Social and Human Capital.
