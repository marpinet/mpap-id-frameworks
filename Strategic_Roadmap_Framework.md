# Strategic Roadmap Framework

The **Strategic Roadmap** framework helps users define a clear, actionable path forward by aligning their future purpose with their current state and identifying key vectors of investment. It also includes waves of initiatives and detailed plans for each vector to systematically close the gap between aspirations and current capabilities.

## Purpose
The Strategic Roadmap framework helps teams:
- Define an inspiring and actionable purpose statement as the future state.
- Assess the current state of the organization, including its assets, capabilities, and gaps.
- Identify key vectors of investment required to achieve the future purpose.
- Create waves of initiatives to drive progress over time.
- Detail initiatives per vector to ensure alignment and execution.

## Sections
### 1. **Frame Purpose as the Future State**
   - Define the organization’s purpose as an aspirational and motivating statement of intent.
   - Articulate the unique benefits and value proposition the organization delivers to its targeted customers and stakeholders.
   - Example format: "Our purpose is to [contribution] so that [impact] by [jobs to be done]."
   - Example: "Our purpose is to revolutionize urban mobility so that cities become more sustainable by developing electric and shared transportation solutions."

### 2. **Summarize the Current State**
   - Describe the organization’s current position from the perspective of primary customers and stakeholders.
   - Identify differentiated assets and capabilities that create potential competitive advantages.
   - Assess the gap between the current state and the future purpose.
   - Key questions:
     - How would customers and stakeholders describe the organization today?
     - What are the organization’s strengths and weaknesses?
     - What is the size of the gap to achieving the purpose?
   - Example: "Currently, the organization has strong R&D capabilities but limited market penetration."

### 3. **Articulate the Vectors of Investment**
   - Define the key streams of investment and activity required to close the gap between the current state and the future purpose. These include:
     1. **Customers and Influencers**:
        - Identify target customer segments and geographic markets.
        - Describe how these will evolve over time.
        - Example: "Focus on urban millennials in North America and Europe."
     2. **Offerings and Value Proposition**:
        - Define the value proposition and customer experience.
        - Identify new innovations to bring to market over time.
        - Example: "Developing a subscription-based electric scooter service."
     3. **Processes and Workflow**:
        - Redesign business processes to deliver the value proposition and enable the desired customer experience.
        - Example: "Streamlining supply chain operations to reduce costs."
     4. **Technology and Data Analytics**:
        - Define how technology systems, data, and analytics capabilities will support the value proposition.
        - Example: "Implementing AI-driven analytics to optimize fleet management."
     5. **People, Organization, and Partnerships**:
        - Identify new organizational roles and partnerships required to deliver the value proposition.
        - Example: "Partnering with renewable energy providers to power the fleet."

### 4. **Create Waves of Initiatives**
   - Define waves of initiatives that will drive progress toward the future purpose.
   - Organize initiatives into sequential waves (e.g., Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave N) based on priority and timing.
   - Ensure initiatives align with the vectors of investment and address the gap between the current and future state.
   - Example: "Wave 1: Launch pilot programs in two cities. Wave 2: Expand to 10 cities."

### 5. **Detail Initiatives per Vector**
   - Break down each initiative within the vectors of investment:
     - Example: "Vector: Technology. Initiative: Develop a mobile app for real-time tracking."
