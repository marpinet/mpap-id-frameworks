# Strategic Roadmap Framework

The **Strategic Roadmap** framework helps users define a clear, actionable path forward by aligning their future purpose with their current state and identifying key vectors of investment. It also includes waves of initiatives and detailed plans for each vector to systematically close the gap between aspirations and current capabilities.

## Purpose
The Strategic Roadmap framework helps teams:
- Define an inspiring and actionable purpose statement as the future state.
- Assess the current state of the organization, including its assets, capabilities, and gaps.
- Identify key vectors of investment required to achieve the future purpose.
- Create waves of initiatives to drive progress over time.
- Detail initiatives per vector to ensure alignment and execution.

     - What are the organization’s strengths and weaknesses?
     - What is the size of the gap to achieving the purpose?

     5. **People, Organization, and Partnerships**:
        - Identify new organizational roles and partnerships required to deliver the value proposition.

### 4. **Create Waves of Initiatives**
   - Define waves of initiatives that will drive progress toward the future purpose.

   - Ensure initiatives align with the vectors of investment and address the gap between the current and future state.

### 5. **Detail Initiatives per Vector**
