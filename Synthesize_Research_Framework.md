# Synthesize Research Framework

The **Synthesize Research** framework helps users organize and distill research findings into a structured hierarchy: facts, key findings, insights, and themes. This framework ensures that research data is synthesized into actionable and meaningful outputs.

## Purpose
The Synthesize Research framework helps teams:
- Organize research findings into a structured hierarchy.
- Distill raw data into actionable insights and overarching themes.
- Create a foundation for decision-making and strategy development.

## Sections
The framework includes the following components:

1. **Facts**:
   - Individual data points or observations from research.
   - Example: "50% of users prefer X," "Customer feedback highlights Y."

2. **Key Findings**:
   - Patterns or trends derived from 3+ related facts.
   - Example: "Users prefer X because of its simplicity."

3. **Insights**:
   - Deeper understanding or interpretation derived from 3+ key findings.
   - Example: "Simplicity is a critical driver of user satisfaction."

4. **Themes**:
   - Overarching concepts or strategic directions derived from 3+ insights.
   - Example: "Focus on simplicity to enhance user experience."

## Definitions
- **Facts**: Individual data points or observations collected during research.
- **Key Findings**: Patterns or trends identified from multiple related facts.
- **Insights**: Deeper understanding or interpretation derived from key findings.
- **Themes**: Overarching concepts or strategic directions based on insights.

## Interaction Methods
Users can interact with the Synthesize Research framework in three ways:
1. **Upload Files**: Upload research reports, transcripts, or raw data to auto-fill sections of the framework.
2. **Chat with AI**: Answer questions from the AI agent to organize research findings into the hierarchy.
3. **Guided Steps**: Follow detailed instructions to manually synthesize research findings.

## Output
The completed Synthesize Research framework will be presented as:
- A structured document summarizing facts, key findings, insights, and themes.
- A downloadable PDF version of the framework.
- An option to save the framework to the user’s profile for future reference or reuse.
