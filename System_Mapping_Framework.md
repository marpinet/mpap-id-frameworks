# System Mapping Framework

The **System Mapping** framework helps users visualize and understand the relationships, dependencies, and power dynamics within a system. It is designed to identify key stakeholders, their interactions, and leverage points for intervention.

## Purpose
The System Mapping framework helps teams:
- Identify stakeholders and their roles within a system.
- Understand relationships, dependencies, and power dynamics.
- Highlight leverage points for potential interventions or improvements.

## Sections
The System Mapping framework includes the following components:

1. **Stakeholders**: Identify all relevant stakeholders within the system.
   - Define their roles and influence within the system.
2. **Relationships**: Map the connections and interactions between stakeholders.
   - Highlight dependencies and areas of collaboration or conflict.
3. **Power Dynamics**: Analyze the distribution of power and influence within the system.
   - Identify stakeholders with the most control or influence.
4. **Leverage Points**: Highlight areas within the system where small changes could lead to significant impacts.

## Interaction Methods
Users can interact with the System Mapping framework in three ways:
1. **Upload Files**: Upload documents, diagrams, or stakeholder lists to auto-generate a system map.
2. **Chat with AI**: Answer questions from the AI agent to generate a system map.
3. **Guided Steps**: Follow detailed instructions to manually create the system map.

## Output
The completed System Mapping framework will be presented as:
- A **diagram** visualizing stakeholders, relationships, dependencies, power dynamics, and leverage points.
- A downloadable PDF version of the system map.
- An option to save the system map to the user’s profile for future reference or reuse.
