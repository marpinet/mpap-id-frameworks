# Leverage Points and Interventions Framework

The **Leverage Points and Interventions** framework, inspired by Donella Meadows’ work, helps users identify and prioritize points within a system where small changes can lead to significant improvements. It provides a structured approach to understanding systemic behavior and planning impactful interventions.

## Purpose
The Leverage Points and Interventions framework helps teams:
- Identify leverage points within a system where interventions can create meaningful change.
- Prioritize interventions based on their potential impact and feasibility.
- Develop a clear plan for implementing and monitoring interventions.

## Sections
The framework includes the following components:

1. **System Overview**: Provide a high-level description of the system being analyzed.
   - Example: A supply chain system with multiple vendors and distribution centers.
2. **Leverage Points**: Identify points within the system where small changes can lead to significant improvements.
   - Categorize leverage points (e.g., parameters, feedback loops, system structure, or goals).
   - Example: Adjusting inventory levels to reduce waste.
3. **Intervention Opportunities**: Define specific actions or changes that can be made at each leverage point.
   - Assess the potential impact of each intervention.
   - Evaluate the feasibility of implementing each intervention.
   - Example: Implementing real-time tracking to improve delivery efficiency.
4. **Prioritization**: Rank leverage points and interventions based on their potential impact and feasibility.
   - Example: Prioritizing interventions that are low-cost and high-impact.
5. **Action Plan**: Develop a plan for implementing the top-priority interventions.
   - Include timelines, responsibilities, and success metrics.
   - Example: Assigning a team to oversee the implementation of a new software tool.

## Definitions
- **Leverage Points**: Places within a system where a small change can lead to significant improvements.
- **Intervention Opportunities**: Specific actions or changes that can be made at leverage points to improve the system.

## Interaction Methods
Users can interact with the Leverage Points and Interventions framework in three ways:
1. **Upload Files**: Upload system-related documents or analyses to auto-fill sections of the framework.
2. **Chat with AI**: Answer questions from the AI agent to identify leverage points and interventions.
3. **Guided Steps**: Follow detailed instructions to manually complete each section.

## Output
The completed Leverage Points and Interventions framework will be presented as:
- A structured document summarizing leverage points, interventions, and the action plan.
- A downloadable PDF version of the framework.
- An option to save the framework to the user’s profile for future reference or reuse.
